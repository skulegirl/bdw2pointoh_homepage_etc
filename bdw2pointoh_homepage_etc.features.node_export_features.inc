OFFERS YOU ACCESS TO OUR SITE AND SERVICES.\\r\\n\\r\\nWelcome to the web site operated by Boondockers Welcome Inc. (\\"we,\\" \\"us\\").

Our Site is merely a venue for users to learn about one another and, if they wish, arrange stays with one another. We are not involved in the actual contact between users. As a result, we have no control over the conduct of our users or the truth or accuracy of the information that users post on the Site.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.2 Identity Verification.

We do not investigate any user’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or verify the information such user may submit to the Site.

You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users of our Services. We will not be responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other users of our Services.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: \\"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2.

For any Claim (excluding Claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand US Dollars (US$10,000), you or we may elect to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration conducted by telephone, on-line and/or based solely upon written submissions where no in-person appearance is required.

Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) Court. Alternatively, any Claim may be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Ontario, Canada or where the defendant is located (in our case Ontario, Canada, and in your case your home address). You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a court located in Ontario, Canada or a Canadian federal court.\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) Alternative Dispute Resolution. Alternatively, we will consider use of other forms of ADR, such as binding arbitration to be held in Vermont, USA or another location agreed upon by the parties.\\r\\n\\r\\n(d) Attorney’s Fees. All Claims (excluding requests for injunctive or equitable relief) between the parties must be resolved using the dispute-resolution mechanism that is selected in accordance with this Section 19 by the first party to file a Claim. Should either party file an action contrary to this Section 19, the other party may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to US$5,000, provided that the party seeking the award has notified the other party in writing of the improperly filed Claim, and the other party has failed to withdraw the Claim.\\r\\n\\r\\n20.
